OBJECTIVE 
 
• Monitor Loan Performance – Track total loan applications, funded amounts, and 
repayments over time. 
• Assess Credit Risk – Differentiate between good loans (fully paid, current) and bad loans 
(charged off). 
• Analyze Borrower Profiles – Evaluate factors like employment length, home ownership, 
and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. 
• Identify Trends & Patterns – Visualize loan distribution by state, loan purpose, and term 
duration. 
• Optimize Lending Strategies – Provide data-driven insights for better decision-making and 
risk management. 
• Enhance Cash Flow Analysis – Monitor loan repayments and outstanding balances to 
manage liquidity. 
• Evaluate Interest Rate Impact – Track average interest rates to assess profitability and 
borrower affordability. 
• Improve Regulatory Compliance – Ensure adherence to lending policies through 
structured reporting. 
• Support Financial Planning – Assist in forecasting revenue and managing loan portfolio 
growth effectively.

PROCEDURE 
 
1. Data import 
• Open Excel and start a new or existing workbook. 
• Import Data via Get Data (Excel, CSV, SQL, etc.). 
• Browse and select your dataset to load into Excel. 
• Load the data into the workbook and ensure it's structured. 
• Configure relationships if using multiple tables (via Power Pivot). 
• Save the file after data import and configuration. 
2. Data Collection & Preparation 
• Import the loan dataset into Excel (from CSV, SQL, or other sources). 
• Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting 
columns (e.g., dates, currency, percentages). 
• Create a structured table using Ctrl + T for easy referencing and analysis. 
3. Define Key Metrics & KPIs 
• Identify primary KPIs (e.g., total loan applications, funded amount, received amount, 
interest rate, DTI). 
• Calculate Good vs. Bad Loan ratios based on loan status. 
• Use Excel formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX- 
MATCH, etc.) to derive insights

METHODOLOGY 
Excel Tools Used: 
 
• Power Query: For importing and transforming the data. 
• Formulas: For calculating KPIs and metrics such as loan amounts, interest rates, DTI, and 
repayment status. 
• Pivot Tables: For aggregating data and summarizing loan performance. 
• Charts & Visualizations: For data representation (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts). 
 
Visualizations: 
 
• Line charts, bar charts, pie charts, tree maps, and slicers for dynamic filtering. 
 
o Loan Term (36 vs. 60 months) – To analyze how different durations impact total disbursed 
amounts. 
o Interest Rate – To understand its influence on loan applications and borrower behavior. 
o Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) – To measure how borrower debt affects loan disbursement.
